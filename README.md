Homework due 11/22/2019 Node.js and Express.js activity


### Organization
This node.js app uses Express to create a user-interactive front end that communicates with the node.js backend, providing CREATE and READ functionality.

### How-to operate
This web application is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. 
Begin the survey at your leisure by clicking the button, enter your preferred name and a link to a photo that will be associated with your account.
Please answer the questions absolutely honestly and submit your results to upload your data to the database and allow a matching result!

### Proof Positive
This web application is generously hosted for free by Heroku and is accessable to you at: https://still-retreat-31634.herokuapp.com/

However, should you want to host and view this on your local machine, clone the repository to your machine.
After cloning the repository, npm install to load all required third-party software. 
Following installation the user can initiate the program by entering "server.js. 
Next, the user will have to use a browser to navigate to "localhost:3000", which will display the front end.

### Link to Github Repository
Please clone and install to run.

### Technologies used
This node.js app uses a package.json to facilitate installing third-party software, the "express" and "path" packages, and of course javascript.
Github, Windows Powershell, and Heroku simplify deployment.

### My Role
This is a solo assignment.
